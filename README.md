# CricketAnalytics
In this project, I have implemented Machine Learning techniques to predict the effectiveness of a cricket shot played based on bowler, ball type, and other such conditions.
Scraped ball-by-ball data required from ESPN Cricinfo and developed a novel approach of assigning an effectiveness scale to cricket shots in the analysis parameters based on ball type, outcome, and other contextual conditions. I have utilized Sklearn frameworks to implement the predictive model.
